## Contains settings for perceptual model project processing
# Tracking certain settings (such as local file locations) here helps porting the code to other machines.
# Tracking data sources (URLs) here helps transparency. 

# Overview:
# [setting] | [value] # [description]
#
# [setting]     : Scripts look for this string to identify the line in this file that contains the information they need.
# [value]       : Value of the setting used by the scripts. 
# [description] : Description for user's benefit

# Raw data
# Geospatial data downloaded using CAMELS-SPAT code


# Main settings
code_path | /Users/wmk934/code/perceptual_models/       | string  # Root path of processing code
raw_path  | /Users/wmk934/data/NorthAmerica_geospatial/ | string  # Root path of raw data location
data_path | /Users/wmk934/data/perceptual_models/       | string  # Root path of project data location
temp_path | /Users/wmk934/data/perceptual_models/tmp/   | string  # Path for temporary storage

# 1. Python setup
venv_path | /Users/wmk934/data/perceptual_models/ | string  # Path where the Python virtual environment will be created
venv_name | perc-model-env                        | string  # Virtual environment name
reqs_path | 1_Python_setup/                       | string  # Sub-folders in root that contain requirements
reqs_file | 0_requirements.txt                    | string  # Python environment requirements for `pip install -r reqs.txt`

# 2. Derived data
topo_crs     | ESRI:102009 | string  # Coordinate Reference System to calculate slope and aspect in. ESRI:102009 is North_America_Lambert_Conformal_Conic. Based on recommendation from Chris
last_n_years | 10          | integer # Number of years to use for "recent" data > used to get monthly MODIS LAI averages and mode MODIS land cover

# 3. Resampling
domain | -179.5,-50,5,85 | string # domain for resampling; based on CAMELS-SPAT domain
x_res | 0.00025 | float # highest resolution in source datasets in x direction
y_res | -0.00025 | float # highest resolution in source datasets in y direction
